This package is providing an object oriented real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework developed at the Automation & Robotics Research Group http://wwwde.uni.lu/snt/research/automation_robotics_research_group at the University of Luxembourg. 

It is based on following contributions:

 * J. Dentler, S. Kannan, M. A. O. Mendez and H. Voos, <<BR>>"A modularization approach for nonlinear model predictive control of distributed fast systems", <<BR>>24th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED), Athens, Greece, 2016, pp. 292-297.<<BR>>doi: 10.1109/MED.2016.7535973

The used kernel solver is a "Condensed Multiple Shooting Generalized Minimal Residuum Method (CMSCGMRES)" developed by Prof. Dr. Toshiyuki  OHTSUKA:

Its features include:

 1. nonlinear model predictive control (e.g. a quadrotor with nonlinear system dynamics)
 1. Central control of single agent systems (e.g. a single robot)
 1. Central control of multi-agent systems (e.g. multiple robots that are interacting)
 1. Object oriented code to easily adapt it:
  * Controller: Interface class for implementations of controllers, e.g.CMSCGMRES
  * Agent: Interface class for implementations of agents, respective system or robot types, e.g. Quadrotor
  * Constraint:  Interface class for implementations of single agent constraints
  * Coupling:  Interface class for implementations for coupling agents
 1. Open-source code
